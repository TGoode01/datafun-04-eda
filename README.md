# datafun-04-eda
This is a guided EDA and we'll all use the same data - but tell our stories slightly differently. In the future, you'll use your own custom datasets to apply the process in new areas.

You should have already read and worked through the Jupyter intro in Ch 1.10.3.

Read Chapter 07 and Chapter 08 in our textbook and work through the exercises and examples. The order in the book is a bit different, but these foundational chapters are important. Focus especially on 7.14.2 pandas DataFrames.

Task 1. EDA
 Follow the instructions at https://github.com/denisecase/datafun-04-notebooks/blob/main/docs/EDA.mdLinks to an external site.

Complete Step 1. Initial Title, Header, and Imports

Complete Step 2. Load Data

When finished:

Click "Run All"
Verify the code runs without errors (warnings are okay).
Use git add-commit-push to get your work back up into your GitHub repo. 
Hint: Add your workflow and commands to your README.md for reference. 

The module Skill Drills will provide the lessons needed to complete P4. 

Publishing Your Notebooks
Execute your entire notebook with "Run All" before you push to GitHub and see how nicely they display.
Verify your results appear in the GitHub site as you intend. 
Use the same Markdown syntax to make your README.md file look nice. (Follow capitalization conventions for README.md files - note the README is capitalized. Look like the other professionals.)
You don't have to master Markdown syntax, but everyone should know how to do headings and some basics. 
The more you learn, the better your repositories and notebooks look - it's a good skill to invest in when you have a bit of time.
Do a web search for a cheat sheet or ask your favorite AI. Most everyone else is using https://chat.openai.com/Links to an external site. or something similar - don't be left behind!
